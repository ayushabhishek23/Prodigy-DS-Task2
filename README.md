# Prodigy InfoTech Internship — Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Welcome to my Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship repository!
This repository contains **Task 2**, which focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover important patterns, relationships, and trends within a dataset.

---

## 📌 Task Overview
The objective of this task is to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on a chosen dataset, identify meaningful relationships between variables, and extract insights from visual exploration.
For this task, I used the **Titanic Dataset**, a popular dataset from Kaggle, which includes detailed passenger information such as age, gender, passenger class, ticket type, fare, and survival outcome.

## 🧠 What I Learned
This project helped me gain valuable experience in:
- Handling missing values and dataset inconsistencies
- Detecting and removing duplicate or irrelevant features
- Performing univariate & bivariate analysis to study variable behavior and correlations
- Using visualizations to explore survival patterns and demographic impacts
- Understanding how key attributes like gender, age, and passenger class influence survival probability
- Building structured EDA workflows using Python

## 📊 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- Passengers in 1st class survived more frequently than those in 2nd or 3rd class.
- Younger passengers, especially children, showed comparatively higher chances of survival.
- Higher ticket fare generally correlates with higher survival rates.
- Visualizations such as count plots, histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps offer strong interpretability of patterns.
